# Understanding-Glucose-dynamics
This study poses a great change or rather a highlight towards understanding glucose 
dynamics due to its comparison of data. With such a comparison a data analyzer tends to instil 
his knowledge with the difference he/she finds in the data readings. Given these differences, we 
get to visually represent our study which can help in overcoming the traditional beliefs about 
such monitoring devices
